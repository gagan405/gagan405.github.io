Setting up my blog on Github. 

I have travelled a lot now.

About a decade ago, I started writing random stuff on [Multiply](http://multiply.com), which is now dead. Then I moved on to use wordpress. I still have some junk at my first site on [wordpress](https://gaganmishra.wordpress.com). Later on, I started to note down some of my technical notes at [Cafeaffe on Wordpress](https://cafeaffe.wordpress.com).

The same cafeaffe contents I moved to an EC2 machine on AWS. Created a subdomain under [Umlaut](http://umlaut.in). Added a bunch of posts, but unfortunately the machine got fucked up with all my posts. Lesson learnt : never trust MySQL stability on a free tier AWS machine. Rather use RDS.

So I came back to wordpress. And for some valid or invalid reason, I thought github would be a better choice. And this is how I am here, and will continue to add stuff here from now on.

Cheers!
