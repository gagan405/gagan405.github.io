I'm Gagan, a Software Developer, with a deep love for all things tech! 
I won't go into my professional or educational history (it’s well documented on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaganmishra/)). I can summarize
myself as someone with a wide range of interest and experience, with a current focus on
databases and distributed systems.

I created this space to share my thoughts, curiosities and learnings around Software, Life, Science, Maths, 
Literature, Philosophy etc. Yeah, that’s a lot; curiosity tends to work that way.

When I'm not doing software stuff, I spend my time cooking, reading (mostly history and philosophy these days), 
or learning to play the piano. 🎹
