I'm Gagan, a Software Developer, with a deep love for all things tech! Rather than rehashing my professional journey here (it’s well documented on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaganmishra/)), I wanted this space to feel more personal.

I created this space to share my thoughts, curiosities and learnings around Software, Life, Science, Maths, 
Literature, Philosophy etc. Yeah, that’s a lot hat’s a wide net; curiosity tends to work that way.

When I'm not coding, I spend my time cooking, reading (mostly history and philosophy these days), or learning to play the piano. 🎹
