Here is a summary for later reference:\nJoda LocalDateTime\nJoda LocalDateTime objects are not serialized to human readable ISO date time formats, and rather they appear as a bunch of objects. This could be overcome in version 1.3 by adding a custom ModelConverter in swagger. Unfortunately that was deprecated in version 1.5.\nTo get this to work, I had to get the Swagger object and iterate through all definitions, and replace the LocalDateTime type with proper strong format.\n\nSnake Case\nSwagger also failed to generate proper example request/response objects if @JsonSnakeCase was mentioned. Basically, it just ignored it. Turned out, Swagger was using its own instance of ObjectMapper. To get this to work, I did an override of the default ObjectMapper.\n\nHowever, the same object mapper could not be used to generate the swagger.json definition file. For the simple reason that we do not want to deserialize the Swagger object in our own way and rather let Swagger do it. So, we use a normal ObjectMapper to do it.\n\nAuthorization Header\nIn the generated json definition, I needed Authorization headers to be sent. Somehow, I couldn't figure out a way to do it with Dropwizard, and I ended up modifying the generated Swagger object to add the Authorization requirement.\n\nAfter all these changes, it generated the swagger definition json file correctly. I added all these changes to a resource class which extended the default ApiListingResource. The code can be found here.\nMisc\nI also added two of those findings as answers on StackOverflow.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/40819084\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/40804899\n\n","id":"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/dropwizard-swagger/","title":"Swagger & Dropwizard"},"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/early-experiences-with-gradle/":{"body":"Few days ago I had read someone's blog on how they went with the flow and tried gradle and eventually ended up in a mess and went back to good ol' maven.\nI wasn't really sure then. And I am not really that sure right now either, as my situation is probably different for one reason, and second, I immensely dislike XML files.\nNevertheless, I get what he was saying. Gradle is no smooth sailing. Quite frequently I find myself struggling with making things work. Plugins, versions, sourcesets...\nVersions and Plugins\nGradle is going the python way. Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 ... and nothing compatible with another. One library in one version, wont work the same in another version. Gradle is also in a similar landscape with all the damn plugins.\nGradle as a build tool, does come with certain sets of plugins. But eventually you will end up depending on a bunch of other 3rd party plugins for your needs. For e.g., spring-boot. Now, with every new version of Gradle, the dependent plugins are not guranteed to behave the same as before. Moreover, its not even sure if they will even work at all.\nSo, you are stuck with the old version plugins, and keep hoping to get a newer version released soon so that you can finally close that tech debt item you always wanted to finish.\nMulti projects\nI was a fan of multi module or multi projects. Not anymore!\n\nMany of the plugins do not work seamlessly with multi-project settings. Take for example the release plugin. Or the Jacoco plugin.\nDependency management among all the sub projects is a pain.\nIntegration tests do not work properly when modules depend on each other. I actually had to write sources in one module, unit tests in the same module and integ tests in another module.\n\nMemory and CPU footprint\nI dont know how gradle works under the hood. But whenever I run it, it almost kills my machine. I can make an omlete with that much heat. I was hoping in later versions, with all that daemmon, parallelization, it would get better. But even with version 4.8, it sucks amazingly.\nWell, I am not going away from Gradle anytime soon. But I wish it stabilizes a bit more.\n","id":"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/early-experiences-with-gradle/","title":"Gradle, the pain in ass"},"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/gradle-auto-versioning-per-branch/":{"body":"There is this awesome release plugin which takes care of the usual stuff and more, like checking uncommitted files, checking if commit is pushed or not, and adding release tag etc.\nYou can also customize the release from a specific branch.\nBut then, it still doesn't support versioning per branch. In cases, where you want to have some snapshot (or any other classifier) release from feature branches, and want to keep that separate from main RELEASE versions.\nSo, here is a quick and dirty knock around I did to make it work :\ngradle.properties :\n\nHere, masterVersion is used to track the release versions from master branch and snapshotVersion for any other branch.\nWe need to know which branch we are in :\n\nWe need to set this project.version as thats being read by the release plugin. I couldnt make it work with any random project property. So I had to explicitily write it out.\n\nThe above will be called by\n\nAnd here are the additional methods needed ...\n\nFinally, call the updateVersion task when release is executed :\n\nUse automatic versioning and see it running :\n\n","id":"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/gradle-auto-versioning-per-branch/","title":"Gradle release versioning"},"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/hibernate-sequence-generation/":{"body":"Some years ago I had this weird encounter with hibernate where ids were getting mixed up among 2 different tables, due to last insert id and lazy commit.\nThat was another year, another time and another hibernate version.\nThis time I got a new learning with the ID generation behavior.\nTo the point :\nMake sure database sequence table has the same increment by as the allocationSize in @SequenceGenerator.\n\nWhat happens if they are different ?\nallocationSize (10) &lt; incrementValue (20)\nHibernate gets the next value = 100.\nGenerates Ids till 110.\nRequests for nextValue.

Should be caught during testing.\nWell, what makes it a bit obscure is, when worked with previous version, some properties (I assume hibernate.id.new_generator_mapping) were set in a way that even if there was mismatch, it relied with the increment by value of database.\nWith the 2.0 version of Spring Boot, it comes forward.\nWhat about identity type generation ?\nIdentity type generation is certainly more cleaner, may be not much performant.

This is a summary of the findings.\nBackground\nThis was a Java 8 service running with ParallelGC, primarily consuming messages from an SQS, processing, and sending the response back to another SQS. The processing\ninvolved a bunch of serialization/deserialization along with quite a lot of network calls.\nUpon enabling G1GC for the same service, the GC activities spiked up by at least 15% and processing latency increased proportionally. The below is a gist of\nfinding out issues related to GC and resolving those.\nStep 1 - Enable GC logs\nEnabling GC logs provides more details on whats going on in the service.\n\nStep 2 - Analyze the logs\nAfter enabling detailed GC activity logging, we could see that a lot of GC pauses were ocuring due to Humongous Object allocations. Humongous Objects mean, memory\nchunks of size more than 50% of the G1 block size. The G1 block size depends on the heap memory size and for us it was 4M. So, essentially, any memory allocation more than\n2M was considered as Humongous and too many of those was creating high GC activities and pause times.\nThe logs were analyzed using GCEasy. A really good handy tool to quickly analyze the GC logs.\nSample logs:\n\nStep 3 - Tracing the humongous allocations\nNow that we know that humnogous object allocations are causing so much of trouble, the next step is to identify where exactly the allocations are happening. There are a few blog posts like this which explain a way to trace them. However I tried with JavaFlightRecorder which worked quite smooth.\nRecording with Java Flight Recorder:\n\nOnce the output of JFR is available, we could analyze with JDK Mission Control.\nThe humongous allocations will be visible under Event Browser -&gt; Allocation Outside TLAB.\n\nStep 4 - Removing humongous allocations\nAs seen above, the humongous allocations were created during certain serialization process. On going through the code, it was seen that the code flow actually\nserialized a java object to bytes, compressed it to a gzip bytes, encoded within Base64 and then uploaded to S3.\nThe serialization flow does this:\n\nObjectMapper writes to a byte array: This allocates the most of the memory as seen above in the JFR recording.\nThe byte array is gzipped creating another byte array, shorter in size\nThe resulting byte array is Base64 encoded which creates another byte array of a bit larger size.\nThe byte array is then converted to InputStream and is uploaded to S3.\n\nSample code:\n\nThe above flow actually created 3 new instances of byte[] in each execution. Could we do better? Can we remove certain byte array creations?\nTurns out we can.\nThe new flow looks like:\n\nObject mapper can write to an outputStream instead of a byte array.\nOutputStream can be wrapped inside Base64.encoder which will not require additional array creation for base64 conversion.\nGzip can take the “wrapped” output stream\nObjectMapper can directly write to the Gzipped stream. So no need to create a byte array.\nS3 takes an InputStream. So we can directly convert the above output stream to an inputStream.\n\nSample code after the changes:\nSerialization:\n\nAnd then use the above InputStream to upload objects to S3:\n\nWith the above changes, I ran the JFR once again, and the humongous object allocations were gone! With a substantial (~15%) improvement in GC activities and reduction of FullGC times.\nConclusion\n\nWe should avoid creation of un-necessary byte arrays if we can work with IO streams. The catch here is that, S3 upload might fail in mid-stream and that needs to be taken care of in the code.\nWe should avoid creation of intermediate strings through ObjectMapper. Not covered here in this post, but I did find quite a few instances where we were doing objectMapper.writeValueAsString() and then getting a byte array out of it. The intermediate strings take almost 3 times more memory than byte arrays and provides no great use.\nJFR and JMC are great tools to get better insights into application behavior.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nhttps://www.infoq.com/articles/tuning-tips-G1-GC/\nhttps://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/g1gc.html\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/gctuning/garbage-first-garbage-collector-tuning.htm#JSGCT-GUID-43ADE54E-2054-465C-8376-81CE92B6C1A4\n\n","id":"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/jdk-humongous-allocation/","title":"Optimizing GC time by reducing Humongous allocations"},"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/jdk-migration/":{"body":"I just migrated a legacy service from Java 8 to 17 and it was a smooth experience, except for a few. Here are some lessons learnt in the process.\nBefore anything else, this shows the improvements in the overall GC time after JDK17 migration.\n\nImpressive, isn’t it?\nJava 17 has a lot of changes when compared to Java 8, of course. And the most important one seems to be the strongly encapsulated JDK internals.\nSo, how does it matter to you, as a service code author, who rarely does any playing around with JDK internal APIs?\nWell, we probably don't use them directly. But they could be used through other useful libraries that we use: such as EasyMock/JaxB/PowerMock etc.\nThe process is quite simple though. And here I try to summarize:\nUse Top-Down migration\nCode written and compiled in JDK8/11 will work as a dependency in a package compiled in 17. But we cannot have it the other way round.\nSo, if you have some top level package/service; start with that.\nUpgrade dependency to JDK-17 and fix broken packages\nCertain packages that I found breaking were:\n\nPowerMock\nEasyMock-4.x\n\nRemove PowerMock\nPowerMock has been used primarily to mock:\n\nStatic methods\nFinal classes\nMocking constructors\n\nWhile most of it could be achieved through Mockito-5.* and mockito-inline, it is a good opportunity to re-visit the necessity of such tests.\nIn general, if you need a bytecode mingling library such as PowerMock to test a static method; isn't that a sign of poor code design?\nThere are many articles on the web explaining why you shouldn't be using PowerMock. So, read through them and convince yourself.\nExamples: this, this and this.\nSo, in such cases, I would ask myself:\n\nCan I refactor the code structure to not have static utility classes?\nCan I not mock static methods and go ahead with testing them as part of unit tests.\nCan the new Object(...) code portions be abstracted out to dependency injection frameworks so that I dont have to test those?\nDo I really need final classes?\n\nMany such cases could essentially be refactored out for a better manageable code that wouldn't really require such a library in the first place.\nStateless simple static methods\nIf static util method is something similar to StringUtils.isNotNull(), then don’t mock it and let it execute the real method.\nComplex static methods\nIf the static util method does complex stuff within the utility method, such as n/w calls, FileIO, or some complicated computation: explore options of refactoring. Easiest way is to just make it non-static and have it as an object injected to the consumer class.\nStatic methods from Thread/System classes:\nIf the static method is using System or Thread methods or native methods, such as Thread.sleep() , mockito-inline does not support mocking those methods and consider creating wrapper classes over such methods.\nExample:\n\nStatic methods using Date Times\nIf the static methods rely on date time, consider using mockMethods in the real class and call those from the tests.\nCredit where due: Reference on the below snippet\n\nNOTE : The above also introduced me to a very cool library archunit library. Also, I spent at least 2 hours in getting the regex working for intellij test directory:\n\nCAUTION :\nIn junit4  the expected exceptions are written at the top level such as this:\n\nThe above will NOT work as the final statement will not get executed due to the exception above. To handle these:\n\nUse try...catch  and then reset\nUse AssertJ library method assertThatThrownBy\nOR simply use Junit5: assertThrows(SomeException.class, () -&gt; someMethodWhichThrowsException());\n\nMocking new instantiations\nRefactor to not have such cases and use Dependency Injection.\nTake advantage of DI frameworks and try refactoring the code in a way that you wouldn’t need such cases.\nIf that’s not an option, see below.\nUse Mockito mockConstruction\nNote that mockConstruction doesn’t support argument captor. So, if you want to validate that a certain class was instantiated with a specific type params, you would need to pass a supplier to capture the constructor args, and then assert those. Sample as this.\nThis approach looks un-maintanable, but I am not aware of any better approach yet.\nRemoving EasyMock\nEasyMock-5.x is supposed to work with JDK-17. But do you really need to have 2 separate mocking libraries in your dependency closure?\nChoose one and stick to it preferably. That makes the test cases consistent and uniform across the project.\nIssues With ErrorProne\nErrorProne doesnt work well with Java17 and there are a few open issues such as https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/1250\nThis mostly comes from Lombok generated files not working well with ErrorProne. Some of them are not solved even after adding Generated annotation or using jvmargs specified in the above issue.\nCheckStyle\nThe classic CheckStyle rules do not work with Java17. Some of the module hierarchy have changed. The rules need to be updated. Refer to the latest checkstyle rules and fix them!\nFormatting changes in git\nAs part of checkstyle upgrade, if you are also reformatting your code, then you might want to ignore such commits appearing in your git blame  (IntelliJ annotations). To do that, you can use this git config changes. Here is an article with instructions.\nRuntime tests\nWhen all the tests and builds are going fine, its time to do a runtime test. There could still be errors in runtime due to who knows what library accessing internal JDK APIs!\nOne such error I found was with Jaxb:\n\nSolution is simple. Just add the dependencies to Jaxb-api.\nAlso, JaxB legacy properties have been deprecated long, and they need to be replaced with their upgraded counterparts. For example:\n\nthe above snippet needs to be changed to\n\nSimilarly, many of the old JVM args are now deprecated and that would cause the service to fail to start. Those can simply be ignored by using the flag -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions\nValidation\nVerify how JDK17 is performing with live traffic. What should be the GC/ JVM params and so on.\nConclusion\nThere you have it. Service running with Java 17! Enjoy the optimizations and new language features.\nHappy Coding!\n","id":"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/jdk-migration/","title":"Migrating a legacy service from Java 8 to Java 17"},"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/langford-pairs/":{"body":"Recently I was asked to write some code to generate a Langford Pair. I had never heard of those before.\nA langford sequence is a sequence of numbers where every number appears twice and equal numbers have a difference of their positions equal to their value.\nFor example for n = 4 :       4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2\nClearly, the sequence is of length 2n as every number appears twice.\nIntuitively we fix the highest number at the first position and at the next allowed position :   4 _ _ _ _ 4 _ _\nThen we go to the next number, that is 3 and try to place it at the next possible position :   4 _ 3 _ _ 4 3 _\nNow we try to place 2 : 4 2 3 _ 2 4 3 _\nOops. There is no valid position left for 1 now. So we backtrack, and remove the last number inserted and re-insert that somewhere else. If no re-insertable position found for that number, we backtrack again to the next upper level and try re-position that number and so on.\nSo we backtrack, and remove 2 from its inserted position and check if we have any available position for 2. Turns out we have : 4 _ 3 _ 2 4 3 2\nNow, we found one available position for the 1s in the sequence, and we get the final Langford sequence after placing the 1s there :  4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2\nInteresting to see that there are multiple Langford sequences for the same value of n. For example, if we reverse the previous Langford sequence, it will still be a Langford sequence. So for n = 4, we have 2 such sequences available.\nSo, how do we generate such a sequence ?\nAs I wrote above, it can be easily done using recursion. Define a function that takes an array, and the next number to insert. Now, if it finds a place to insert the number, it inserts them, and recursively calls itself to insert n-1 . If it can’t insert the number it returns, and the calling function will then try re-positioning n  and do the recursion again.\nTurns out it is an expensive process, as we cannot use tail-recursion here. (For that matter in any backtracking algorithm).\nBut, will we always get a Langford sequence for any given number ? Here is a mathematical proof that it can only be feasible when  n MOD 4 = 0 or n MOD 4 = −1\nThat saves us from doing useless recursions and overflowing the stack when we already know no such sequence exists.\nWe can also do it iteratively without recursion. But then, since we need to backtrack when no position is available for a number, we have to keep track of the numbers inserted using a stack.\nThe iteration can also be done in 2 different ways. Either we iterate on the positions, and see what number can be inserted at this position, or we iterate over the numbers, where we answer ‘at what position this number can be inserted’ in every loop. Both will result in different sequences.\nWe can generate all Langford Sequences by back tracking and re-positioning the numbers to the next available position.\nHere is the code that I wrote in some of my spare time, which implements all these 3 approaches.\nReferences :\n\nhttp://datagenetics.com/blog/october32014/index.html\nhttp://dialectrix.com/langford/langford-algorithm.html\n\n","id":"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/langford-pairs/","title":"Langford Pairs"},"https://notes.minbox.in/posts/pdf-organizer/":{"body":"I happen to download a lot of PDF files.

Different APIs behaving differently, conflicting error codes or a HttpStatus of 500 for something like a invalid credit card number or email in the request payload is highly undesirable.\nThe standard way of responding error/exceptional situations is well documented in Spring. This roughly can be done like :\n\nIn your resource method, return a ResponseEntity, with the desired Object body.\nThis will look something like this :\n\n\n\nOr the other way could be, and more preferable way, is to throw Exceptions and write Exception mappers which then convert the exceptions to appropriate response objects. Google for it and numerous examples are available on this.\n\nQuite some time ago, I found this Zalando Problems library, that takes the second approach, and generates nice reponse structures for various exception types, and is easy integrated with Spring Boot.\nTheir package, by default handles quite a number of exception types. But, as the need to have custom exception types come, we have to provide AdviceTraits for the new exception types. Which is done like something as below :\nA custom exception class :\n\nAn advice trait that converts it to a response object:\n\nNow we plug this in along with the other traits:\n(ProblemHandling is the packaged interface from zalando library.)\n\nWe need to provide this as a ControllerAdvice so that spring makes use of it.\n\nAnd thats it!
