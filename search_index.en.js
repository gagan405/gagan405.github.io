Of course, the debian control files, and file heirarchies are project specific and needs to be changed as per requirements.\nAs mentioned, I added a couple of tasks, starting with the one allJar which creates a fat jar with all the complied class files :\n\nThe task copyToLib is used here to include any external jar files located in lib directories.\n\nAfter this, we can just add all the required tasks in one single file, for e.g., debian.gradle.\n\nOf course, the string constants are to be replaced as per requirements of the project.

Here is a summary for later reference:\nJoda LocalDateTime\nJoda LocalDateTime objects are not serialized to human readable ISO date time formats, and rather they appear as a bunch of objects. This could be overcome in version 1.3 by adding a custom ModelConverter in swagger. Unfortunately that was deprecated in version 1.5.\nTo get this to work, I had to get the Swagger object and iterate through all definitions, and replace the LocalDateTime type with proper strong format.\n\nSnake Case\nSwagger also failed to generate proper example request/response objects if @JsonSnakeCase was mentioned. Basically, it just ignored it. Turned out, Swagger was using its own instance of ObjectMapper. To get this to work, I did an override of the default ObjectMapper.\n\nHowever, the same object mapper could not be used to generate the swagger.json definition file. For the simple reason that we do not want to deserialize the Swagger object in our own way and rather let Swagger do it. So, we use a normal ObjectMapper to do it.\n\nAuthorization Header\nIn the generated json definition, I needed Authorization headers to be sent. Somehow, I couldn't figure out a way to do it with Dropwizard, and I ended up modifying the generated Swagger object to add the Authorization requirement.\n\nAfter all these changes, it generated the swagger definition json file correctly. I added all these changes to a resource class which extended the default ApiListingResource. The code can be found here.\nMisc\nI also added two of those findings as answers on StackOverflow.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/40819084\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/40804899\n\n","id":"https://gagan405.github.io/posts/dropwizard-swagger/","title":"Swagger & Dropwizard"},"https://gagan405.github.io/posts/early-experiences-with-gradle/":{"body":"Few days ago I had read someone's blog on how they went with the flow and tried gradle and eventually ended up in a mess and went back to good ol' maven.\nI wasn't really sure then. And I am not really that sure right now either, as my situation is probably different for one reason, and second, I immensely dislike XML files.\nNevertheless, I get what he was saying. Gradle is no smooth sailing. Quite frequently I find myself struggling with making things work. Plugins, versions, sourcesets...\nVersions and Plugins\nGradle is going the python way. Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 ... and nothing compatible with another. One library in one version, wont work the same in another version. Gradle is also in a similar landscape with all the damn plugins.\nGradle as a build tool, does come with certain sets of plugins. But eventually you will end up depending on a bunch of other 3rd party plugins for your needs. For e.g., spring-boot. Now, with every new version of Gradle, the dependent plugins are not guranteed to behave the same as before. Moreover, its not even sure if they will even work at all.\nSo, you are stuck with the old version plugins, and keep hoping to get a newer version released soon so that you can finally close that tech debt item you always wanted to finish.\nMulti projects\nI was a fan of multi module or multi projects. Not anymore!\n\nMany of the plugins do not work seamlessly with multi-project settings. Take for example the release plugin. Or the Jacoco plugin.\nDependency management among all the sub projects is a pain.\nIntegration tests do not work properly when modules depend on each other. I actually had to write sources in one module, unit tests in the same module and integ tests in another module.\n\nMemory and CPU footprint\nI dont know how gradle works under the hood. But whenever I run it, it almost kills my machine. I can make an omlete with that much heat. I was hoping in later versions, with all that daemmon, parallelization, it would get better. But even with version 4.8, it sucks amazingly.\nWell, I am not going away from Gradle anytime soon.

I don’t exactly remember the\nHibernate version or detailed configurations, like isolation levels. The below is the best I could do with my memory.)\nThe Problem\nWe discovered that invoice numbers were being generated out of sequence for shipments containing multiple orders.\nInstead of clean sequences like:\n\nwe occasionally saw results such as:\n\nThis only happened for shipments with multiple orders, and the pattern was inconsistent across environments,\nsometimes all invoices were wrong, sometimes only one, and sometimes none at all.\nHow Invoice Numbers Were Generated\nAt the time, invoice numbers were generated using a custom sequence table and MySQL’s LAST_INSERT_ID() function.\nThe flow looked like this:\n\nIncrement the sequence:\n\n\n\nFetch the generated value:\n\n\n\nInsert the invoice number into InvoiceNumber\nInsert an outbound message into another table (to notify other consumers of invoice event)\n\nThe Key Assumption\nThis logic only works if steps 1 and 2 execute atomically, i.e., with no inserts happening in between. Otherwise, LAST_INSERT_ID() can change.\nWhat Went Wrong\nHibernate Flush Behavior\nFor shipments with multiple orders, this logic ran inside a loop.\nHibernate (JPA), for performance reasons, does not immediately execute insert statements. Instead, it queues them and\nflushes later. Either:\n\nat transaction commit, or\nautomatically before executing certain queries.\n\nThis led to a subtle but fatal interaction.\nWhy LAST_INSERT_ID() Broke\nIn MySQL:\n\n\nIf an insert happens on a table with an AUTO_INCREMENT column, it overwrites LAST_INSERT_ID().\n\n\nIf the table has no auto-increment, LAST_INSERT_ID() becomes 0.\n\n\nHibernate sometimes flushed pending inserts between:\n\nthe sequence update, and\nthe select LAST_INSERT_ID() call.\n\nWhen that happened, the invoice number suddenly came from an entirely different table.\nObserved Behavior in Different Environments\nBecause Hibernate’s default flush mode is AUTO, the timing was unpredictable.\nWe observed several patterns:\na) Local Environment\nFor a shipment with 3 orders:\n\nThe first invoice was correct\nThe next two were wrong\n\nHibernate flushed inserts right before the next iteration’s select LAST_INSERT_ID(), corrupting the value.\nb) Production – Flush Only at Commit\nSome shipments flushed only when the transaction closed.\nNo errors occurred\nc) Flush at the Last Order\nHibernate flushed inserts only during the final iteration.\nOnly the last invoice was corrupted: in 10 orders, only the last one was corrupt\nd) Flush Mid-Loop\nHibernate flushed somewhere in the middle.\n\nOne random order was corrupted\nExample: 4 orders, 2nd one corrupted\n\nThere was no fixed pattern.\nWhy This Happened\nHibernate always flushes before executing a native query.\nSince select LAST_INSERT_ID() is a native query, Hibernate triggered a flush—but only if there were pending inserts.\nThis behavior is documented and consistent with Hibernate’s implementation:\n\nDefault flush mode: AUTO\nMeaning: Hibernate may flush “sometimes”\n\nImpact\n\nShipments with multiple orders generated invalid invoice numbers\nInvoice sequences jumped unexpectedly\nDownstream systems were affected due to incorrect invoice references\n\nThe Fix\nWe made two key changes:\n1. Removed LAST_INSERT_ID() Entirely\n\nReplaced the update/select logic with a SELECT … FOR UPDATE on the sequence row\nEnsured correctness without relying on session-level side effects\n\n2. Generate Invoice Numbers in One Shot\nInstead of generating numbers inside a loop\n\n\nWe queried and reserved all required invoice numbers once per shipment\n\n\nThis eliminated flush-related timing issues completely.\n\n\nWhy Tests Didn’t Catch It\n\n\nUnit tests used mocked databases\n\n\nMock DBs don’t replicate:\n\nLAST_INSERT_ID() semantics\nHibernate flush timing\n\n\n\nThe issue was non-deterministic, making it nearly impossible to catch with small test runs\n\n\nInteg tests missing multiple orders in one shipment\n\n\nLessons Learned\n\nNever rely on LAST_INSERT_ID() across multiple statements unless they are truly atomic\nORM flush behavior matters, especially with native queries\nMocked DB tests are insufficient for sequence and concurrency bugs\nPrefer explicit locking (FOR UPDATE) or database-native sequences\nGenerate identifiers outside loops whenever possible\nRun integration tests with all possible scenarios\n\n","id":"https://gagan405.github.io/posts/hibernate-sequence-native-query/","title":"Hibernate, Flush Mode, and Broken Invoice Numbers"},"https://gagan405.github.io/posts/jdk-humongous-allocation/":{"body":"Recently I was debugging into latency problems in a service and figured quite a few GC related issues on the way. This is a summary of the findings.\nBackground\nThis was a Java 8 service running with ParallelGC, primarily consuming messages from an SQS, processing, and sending the response back to another SQS. The processing\ninvolved a bunch of serialization/deserialization along with quite a lot of network calls.\nUpon enabling G1GC for the same service, the GC activities spiked up by at least 15% and processing latency increased proportionally. The below is a gist of\nfinding out issues related to GC and resolving those.\nStep 1 - Enable GC logs\nEnabling GC logs provides more details on whats going on in the service.\n\nStep 2 - Analyze the logs\nAfter enabling detailed GC activity logging, we could see that a lot of GC pauses were ocuring due to Humongous Object allocations. Humongous Objects mean, memory\nchunks of size more than 50% of the G1 block size. The G1 block size depends on the heap memory size and for us it was 4M. So, essentially, any memory allocation more than\n2M was considered as Humongous and too many of those was creating high GC activities and pause times.\nThe logs were analyzed using GCEasy. A really good handy tool to quickly analyze the GC logs.\nSample logs:\n\nStep 3 - Tracing the humongous allocations\nNow that we know that humnogous object allocations are causing so much of trouble, the next step is to identify where exactly the allocations are happening. There are a few blog posts like this which explain a way to trace them. However I tried with JavaFlightRecorder which worked quite smooth.\nRecording with Java Flight Recorder:\n\nOnce the output of JFR is available, we could analyze with JDK Mission Control.\nThe humongous allocations will be visible under Event Browser -&gt; Allocation Outside TLAB.\n\nStep 4 - Removing humongous allocations\nAs seen above, the humongous allocations were created during certain serialization process. On going through the code, it was seen that the code flow actually\nserialized a java object to bytes, compressed it to a gzip bytes, encoded within Base64 and then uploaded to S3.\nThe serialization flow does this:\n\nObjectMapper writes to a byte array: This allocates the most of the memory as seen above in the JFR recording.\nThe byte array is gzipped creating another byte array, shorter in size\nThe resulting byte array is Base64 encoded which creates another byte array of a bit larger size.\nThe byte array is then converted to InputStream and is uploaded to S3.\n\nSample code:\n\nThe above flow actually created 3 new instances of byte[] in each execution. Could we do better? Can we remove certain byte array creations?\nTurns out we can.\nThe new flow looks like:\n\nObject mapper can write to an outputStream instead of a byte array.\nOutputStream can be wrapped inside Base64.encoder which will not require additional array creation for base64 conversion.\nGzip can take the “wrapped” output stream\nObjectMapper can directly write to the Gzipped stream. So no need to create a byte array.\nS3 takes an InputStream. So we can directly convert the above output stream to an inputStream.\n\nSample code after the changes:\nSerialization:\n\nAnd then use the above InputStream to upload objects to S3:\n\nWith the above changes, I ran the JFR once again, and the humongous object allocations were gone! With a substantial (~15%) improvement in GC activities and reduction of FullGC times.\nConclusion\n\nWe should avoid creation of un-necessary byte arrays if we can work with IO streams. The catch here is that, S3 upload might fail in mid-stream and that needs to be taken care of in the code.\nWe should avoid creation of intermediate strings through ObjectMapper. Not covered here in this post, but I did find quite a few instances where we were doing objectMapper.writeValueAsString() and then getting a byte array out of it. The intermediate strings take almost 3 times more memory than byte arrays and provides no great use.\nJFR and JMC are great tools to get better insights into application behavior.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nhttps://www.infoq.com/articles/tuning-tips-G1-GC/\nhttps://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/g1gc.html\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/gctuning/garbage-first-garbage-collector-tuning.htm#JSGCT-GUID-43ADE54E-2054-465C-8376-81CE92B6C1A4\n\n","id":"https://gagan405.github.io/posts/jdk-humongous-allocation/","title":"Optimizing GC time by reducing Humongous allocations"},"https://gagan405.github.io/posts/jdk-migration/":{"body":"I just migrated a legacy service from Java 8 to 17 and it was a smooth experience, except for a few. Here are some lessons learnt in the process.\nBefore anything else, this shows the improvements in the overall GC time after JDK17 migration.\n\nImpressive, isn’t it?\nJava 17 has a lot of changes when compared to Java 8, of course. And the most important one seems to be the strongly encapsulated JDK internals.\nSo, how does it matter to you, as a service code author, who rarely does any playing around with JDK internal APIs?\nWell, we probably don't use them directly. But they could be used through other useful libraries that we use: such as EasyMock/JaxB/PowerMock etc.\nThe process is quite simple though. And here I try to summarize:\nUse Top-Down migration\nCode written and compiled in JDK8/11 will work as a dependency in a package compiled in 17. But we cannot have it the other way round.\nSo, if you have some top level package/service; start with that.\nUpgrade dependency to JDK-17 and fix broken packages\nCertain packages that I found breaking were:\n\nPowerMock\nEasyMock-4.x\n\nRemove PowerMock\nPowerMock has been used primarily to mock:\n\nStatic methods\nFinal classes\nMocking constructors\n\nWhile most of it could be achieved through Mockito-5.* and mockito-inline, it is a good opportunity to re-visit the necessity of such tests.\nIn general, if you need a bytecode mingling library such as PowerMock to test a static method; isn't that a sign of poor code design?\nThere are many articles on the web explaining why you shouldn't be using PowerMock. So, read through them and convince yourself.\nExamples: this, this and this.\nSo, in such cases, I would ask myself:\n\nCan I refactor the code structure to not have static utility classes?\nCan I not mock static methods and go ahead with testing them as part of unit tests.\nCan the new Object(...) code portions be abstracted out to dependency injection frameworks so that I dont have to test those?\nDo I really need final classes?\n\nMany such cases could essentially be refactored out for a better manageable code that wouldn't really require such a library in the first place.\nStateless simple static methods\nIf static util method is something similar to StringUtils.isNotNull(), then don’t mock it and let it execute the real method.\nComplex static methods\nIf the static util method does complex stuff within the utility method, such as n/w calls, FileIO, or some complicated computation: explore options of refactoring. Easiest way is to just make it non-static and have it as an object injected to the consumer class.\nStatic methods from Thread/System classes:\nIf the static method is using System or Thread methods or native methods, such as Thread.sleep() , mockito-inline does not support mocking those methods and consider creating wrapper classes over such methods.\nExample:\n\nStatic methods using Date Times\nIf the static methods rely on date time, consider using mockMethods in the real class and call those from the tests.\nCredit where due: Reference on the below snippet\n\nNOTE : The above also introduced me to a very cool library archunit library. Also, I spent at least 2 hours in getting the regex working for intellij test directory:\n\nCAUTION :\nIn junit4  the expected exceptions are written at the top level such as this:\n\nThe above will NOT work as the final statement will not get executed due to the exception above. To handle these:\n\nUse try...catch  and then reset\nUse AssertJ library method assertThatThrownBy\nOR simply use Junit5: assertThrows(SomeException.class, () -&gt; someMethodWhichThrowsException());\n\nMocking new instantiations\nRefactor to not have such cases and use Dependency Injection.\nTake advantage of DI frameworks and try refactoring the code in a way that you wouldn’t need such cases.\nIf that’s not an option, see below.\nUse Mockito mockConstruction\nNote that mockConstruction doesn’t support argument captor. So, if you want to validate that a certain class was instantiated with a specific type params, you would need to pass a supplier to capture the constructor args, and then assert those. Sample as this.\nThis approach looks un-maintanable, but I am not aware of any better approach yet.\nRemoving EasyMock\nEasyMock-5.x is supposed to work with JDK-17. But do you really need to have 2 separate mocking libraries in your dependency closure?\nChoose one and stick to it preferably. That makes the test cases consistent and uniform across the project.\nIssues With ErrorProne\nErrorProne doesnt work well with Java17 and there are a few open issues such as https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/1250\nThis mostly comes from Lombok generated files not working well with ErrorProne. Some of them are not solved even after adding Generated annotation or using jvmargs specified in the above issue.\nCheckStyle\nThe classic CheckStyle rules do not work with Java17. Some of the module hierarchy have changed. The rules need to be updated. Refer to the latest checkstyle rules and fix them!\nFormatting changes in git\nAs part of checkstyle upgrade, if you are also reformatting your code, then you might want to ignore such commits appearing in your git blame  (IntelliJ annotations). To do that, you can use this git config changes. Here is an article with instructions.\nRuntime tests\nWhen all the tests and builds are going fine, its time to do a runtime test. There could still be errors in runtime due to who knows what library accessing internal JDK APIs!\nOne such error I found was with Jaxb:\n\nSolution is simple. Just add the dependencies to Jaxb-api.\nAlso, JaxB legacy properties have been deprecated long, and they need to be replaced with their upgraded counterparts. For example:\n\nthe above snippet needs to be changed to\n\nSimilarly, many of the old JVM args are now deprecated and that would cause the service to fail to start. Those can simply be ignored by using the flag -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions\nValidation\nVerify how JDK17 is performing with live traffic. What should be the GC/ JVM params and so on.\nConclusion\nThere you have it. Service running with Java 17!

I had never heard of those before.\nA langford sequence is a sequence of numbers where every number appears twice and equal numbers have a difference of their positions equal to their value.\nFor example for n = 4 :       4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2\nClearly, the sequence is of length 2n as every number appears twice.\nIntuitively we fix the highest number at the first position and at the next allowed position :   4 _ _ _ _ 4 _ _\nThen we go to the next number, that is 3 and try to place it at the next possible position :   4 _ 3 _ _ 4 3 _\nNow we try to place 2 : 4 2 3 _ 2 4 3 _\nOops. There is no valid position left for 1 now. So we backtrack, and remove the last number inserted and re-insert that somewhere else. If no re-insertable position found for that number, we backtrack again to the next upper level and try re-position that number and so on.\nSo we backtrack, and remove 2 from its inserted position and check if we have any available position for 2. Turns out we have : 4 _ 3 _ 2 4 3 2\nNow, we found one available position for the 1s in the sequence, and we get the final Langford sequence after placing the 1s there :  4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2\nInteresting to see that there are multiple Langford sequences for the same value of n. For example, if we reverse the previous Langford sequence, it will still be a Langford sequence. So for n = 4, we have 2 such sequences available.\nSo, how do we generate such a sequence ?\nAs I wrote above, it can be easily done using recursion. Define a function that takes an array, and the next number to insert. Now, if it finds a place to insert the number, it inserts them, and recursively calls itself to insert n-1 . If it can’t insert the number it returns, and the calling function will then try re-positioning n  and do the recursion again.\nTurns out it is an expensive process, as we cannot use tail-recursion here. (For that matter in any backtracking algorithm).\nBut, will we always get a Langford sequence for any given number ? Here is a mathematical proof that it can only be feasible when  n MOD 4 = 0 or n MOD 4 = −1\nThat saves us from doing useless recursions and overflowing the stack when we already know no such sequence exists.\nWe can also do it iteratively without recursion. But then, since we need to backtrack when no position is available for a number, we have to keep track of the numbers inserted using a stack.\nThe iteration can also be done in 2 different ways. Either we iterate on the positions, and see what number can be inserted at this position, or we iterate over the numbers, where we answer ‘at what position this number can be inserted’ in every loop. Both will result in different sequences.\nWe can generate all Langford Sequences by back tracking and re-positioning the numbers to the next available position.\nHere is the code that I wrote in some of my spare time, which implements all these 3 approaches.\nReferences :\n\nhttp://datagenetics.com/blog/october32014/index.html\nhttp://dialectrix.com/langford/langford-algorithm.html\n\n","id":"https://gagan405.github.io/posts/langford-pairs/","title":"Langford Pairs"},"https://gagan405.github.io/posts/oracle-cloud-wtf/":{"body":"First impressions with OCI\nI am surprised and utterly disappointed with how OCI cannot handle super basic stuff.\nHere is what I did:\n\nCreate a free tier instance\nssh to the instance\ntry installing openjdk, or just yum update\n\n\n\nthat hangs\ncan't ssh to the same instance anymore\n\nThis, while there has been no changes in security rules!
